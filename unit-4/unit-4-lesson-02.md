## Key Points


👋 Welcome & Do Now (5) :
- Engage students and set a positive tone for the lesson.
- Direct students to complete the Do Now.
- Invite a student to share their 'Do Now' activity solution and discuss it with the class.<br><br>

🔤 String Concatenation (10) :
- Define string concatenation as the process of joining multiple strings together.
- Use examples to show how the + operator is used to concatenate strings.
- Discuss the difference between numbers and strings within variables.
- Highlight how to concatenate strings with and without variables.
- Emphasize the absence of quotation marks around variable names during concatenation.<br><br>

💻 Code Along (7) : 
- Lead a live coding session where students follow along.
- Create a simple application that constructs sentences using string concatenation.<br><br>

💻 Code Solo, Part 1 & Review (6) : 
- Students will independently write code that concatenates given strings to form sentences. 
- They will then display the result on their screen.<br><br>

💻 Code Solo, Part 2 (10) :
- Allow students to practice more complex string concatenation examples, providing support as needed.<br><br>

👋 Exit Ticket & Closing (5)
- Direct students to complete the Exit Ticket in Google Classroom to assess their understanding of string concatenation
- Ensure students submit their exit tickets and provide a brief closing to summarize the day's learning and prep them for the next class.<br><br>
