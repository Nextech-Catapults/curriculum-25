## Key Points
This lesson focuses on three key areas: understanding the Box Model, which breaks down the layout of an element into content, padding, border, and margin; utilizing Flexbox, a collection of CSS properties for neatly arranging elements on a web page; and introducing positioning properties for precise control over element placement.


- üëã Welcome (2) : 
    - Greeting students and setting the tone for the lesson.
    - There is no Do Now for this lesson, since there is a lot of content. <br><br>

- üñºÔ∏è Box Model (8) : 
    - Discuss how each webpage element is a rectangular box comprising content, padding, border, and margin.
    - Encourage students to identify what each number in a provided Box Model example represents.
    - Guide students to add borders, padding, and margins to HTML elements using provided code examples.<br><br>

- üíª Code Along (5) :
    - Lead students through coding exercises that demonstrate the box model. Provide help and answer questions as students follow along.<br><br>

- ‚ß† Flexbox & Position (10) : 
    - Explain how Flexbox organizes content, utilizing <div> tags and parent-child relationships.
    - Guide students to assign values for aligning content using Flexbox properties.
    - Briefly explore various positioning values and encourage students to experiment further. <br><br>

- üíª Code Solo (10) : 
    - Students apply the concepts of the Flexbox and Positioning to complete individual coding exercises.
    - Provide assistance as needed, and encourage students to experiment and explore. <br><br>

- üëã Exit Ticket & Closing (5) :

## Common Misconceptions

1. **Box Model Confusion:**
   * **Misconception:** Padding, border, and margin are often interchangeable or confused with one another.
   * **Clarification:** Padding creates space within the element, between the content and the border; the border is a visible line that goes around the padding and content; and margin creates space outside the border, between elements.

2. **Understanding Flexbox:**
   * **Misconception:** The concept of flex containers and flex items can be confusing, leading to incorrect assumptions about how items will be arranged.
   * **Clarification:** The container's properties affect the layout of the items inside, and understanding parent-child relationships is essential to properly using Flexbox.
