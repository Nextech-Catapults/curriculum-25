## Key Points
This lesson focuses on reviewing and debugging HTML and CSS concepts. Students are guided through the principles of clean coding and effective debugging strategies. Additionally, the lesson revisits core HTML and CSS concepts, such as structuring web pages, adding style, using selectors, and emphasizes the importance of these technologies in web development, preparing students for a coding challenge.

## Common Misconceptions
1. **Debugging Is About Finding Major Mistakes Only:**
   - **Misconception:** Debugging is often misunderstood as the process to find only major or catastrophic errors.
   - **Clarification:** Debugging is about finding and fixing any errors, even minor ones, and improving code quality. It‚Äôs a regular part of the coding process, not just something done when there's a significant failure.

2. **Writing More Code Lines Is Always Better (or Worse):**
   - **Misconception:** Some may think that more lines of code mean better quality, while others may believe that fewer lines are always preferable.
   - **Clarification:** Quality coding is about writing clean, readable, and efficient code. Sometimes that requires more lines for clarity, and sometimes concise code is more effective. Neither is inherently better or worse.

3. **CSS Is Just About Making Things Look Pretty:**
   - **Misconception:** CSS is often reduced to just colors, fonts, and basic styling.
   - **Clarification:** While CSS does control aesthetics, it also handles layout, responsiveness, animation, and other complex design aspects. It's a powerful tool for overall user experience, not just superficial design.

4. **Errors and Bugs Are a Sign of Failure or Lack of Skill:**
   - **Misconception:** Encountering errors or bugs in code is often seen as a sign that a programmer has failed or lacks skill.
   - **Clarification:** Even experienced programmers encounter errors and bugs. They are a natural part of the development process and can even be helpful learning tools. Debugging is a vital skill that helps programmers understand their code better, and facing errors doesn't mean failure or incompetence.
