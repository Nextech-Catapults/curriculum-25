## Common Misconceptions
1. **Accessibility Only Benefits People with Disabilities:** This misconception overlooks that good accessibility design enhances the user experience for everyone, not just those with disabilities.

2. **Accessibility is Costly and Time-consuming:** The belief that making content accessible is overly expensive or burdensome can hinder its implementation, whereas planning for accessibility from the start often requires minimal extra effort or cost.

3. **Contrast is a Design Choice Only:** Failing to recognize the significance of color contrast in readability, especially for vision-impaired users, can lead to accessibility issues.

4. **Alt Tags are Optional:** Thinking that alt attributes for images are just a decorative or optional element may overlook their vital role in making content accessible for visually impaired users using screen readers.
